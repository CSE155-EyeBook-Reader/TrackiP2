## Overview
### Description
Trackii is a mobile application that provides accessibility for a pdf-reader by tracking the users' eyes.

Technological progress can only be defined as progress in all directions for all of society, which requires inclusivity. Trackii, aims to inspire and provide solutions to enable more humans to interact with pdfs in a user-friendly manner.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Books and Reference
- **Mobile:** This app is primarily developed as a mobile application but would be viable as a desktop application or an android application. Functionality and features are not just limited to mobile devices.

- **Story:** Stores a users e-books through a pdf, and provides optionality to upload new pdfs. User can then open an e-book and allow user to scroll through book and exit reading through use of eyes.

- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use and read through this app. Usable for users of all age demographics.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or often as user wants depending on a users physical ability or limitations.

- **Scope:** First we would start with selecting a book then we would then calibrate our eye tracking application to prepare for reading. A new windows then would be opened with the e-book to read which can now be controlled with the userâ€™s eyes to scroll and also exit the book.
